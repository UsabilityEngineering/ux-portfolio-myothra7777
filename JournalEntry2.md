# Can Social Media UX Be Further Improved?

## Dylan Davidson 5/2/21

Social media has come a long way since it first took off in the myspace era (roughly 2005-2008) in terms of UX and design. Back in the old days, social media could only be accessed on computers and no phones were capable of running social media websites and apps. Back in that time social media UX was terrible and often did not flow together well, but now almost all social media follows a similar layout and similar user flow. As you can see in the picture below, the old way of doing social media was not optimal nor did it make much sense because there are far too many things going on at once and there are too many navigation options present at any given time.

With the "new" way of handling social media UX shown below, users can find almost all features and functionality of the site/application crammed within four to six little tabs at the top or bottom of the screen. This makes use of the site/application immensely more **learnable** and also improves the **efficiency** of the user flow. Having social media built this way allows users to get to where they want to be with fewer scrolls and taps then ever before. The four pictures below are screenshots of Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram, which I personally like to consider the "big four" platforms in the social media world. As you can see, Facebook has these tabs grouped at the top of the screen while Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram all have these tabs placed at the bottom of the screen. The fact that the "big four" all have a similar layout is no coincidence, it is apparent that this is the layout users are now familiar with and find most convenient for navigation.

I believe that most people would agree with me when I say that social media UX is practically as good as things can be currently, and that any changes to this system would not necessarily improve user experience, but would rather be changing for the sake of change. It seems that the last extreme UX paradigm overhaul came with the increased popularity and use of touch screen devices and smart phones over traditional PCs, and I would argue that no immense change or benefits to UX will arise again until there is some sort of technological advancement or development that allows/forces these changes to come.

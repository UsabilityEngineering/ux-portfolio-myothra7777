# Are Steering Wheels Truly Intuitive?

## Dylan Davidson 3/7/21

Ever since I began learning about UX (User eXperience) in this class I have been noticing so many strange technology designs all over that in the past I never thought twice about. From doors to chairs to even cars I have been noticing strange details and features of objects that don't often make sense unless they are explained to you by somebody who is already familiar with them. One example I have been thinking about is the steering wheel of a car. Just about everybody knows how to work a steering wheel because they have driven a car themselves or have at least watched somebody else drive a car at some point in their life. Ignoring the fact that most know how to work a steering wheel, imagine sitting down in a car for the first time not having a clue what anything does and looking at the wheel in front of you wondering what it does. I argue that a steering wheel does not have many **afforances** (obvious indicators of what the object is used for) and they do not have a great visual **mapping** (visual cues that show you what functions an object can achieve) such as labels or tire visuals that show someone with no knowledge what the object is used for. Below are pictures of my Toyota Camry's steering wheel which I was looking at when I realized this would be a great subject for my UX journal entry.

At a glance of the wheel you can't get much information about it other than the buttons on it which are mostly mapped well to correspond to functions on the display and radio such as the directional buttons and the answer phone / hang up phone buttons. But if I'm being honest, some of these button mappings are horrific. I to this day still have no clue what the curved arrow button or the "Mode Hold" buttons on the left side of the wheel even do. Poor mappings and lack of afordance in design such as this cause the user to either ignore functionality that may prove useful, or force them to read through the dreaded user manual. 

After someone would spend a moment twisting the wheel left and right one might notice that you can feel and hear the tires moving beneath you and you would quickly be able to understand how it works to turn the car's wheels. A huge benefit of steering wheels is how **learnable** they are due to the hidden aid from the power steering unit which allows you to quickly learn how much pressure to apply to the wheel to turn the tires as desired. Steering wheels are a prime example of a highly learnable technology because when first learning to drive steering and staying in the lanes seems difficult, but in no time we are able to drive and steer extremely well without even putting forth much effort. Overall, I feel that without prior knowledge of how steering wheels work, they would be confusing to understand and use. However, once you actually begin interacting with the wheel, it quickly becomes understandable to anybody. Not much can be improved on the design of the wheel itself, but I feel that some added visuals that signify "this action will move your tires this way" could help those driving for the first time out.
